# AURELION

> **A**dvanced & **U**nified **R**eal-time **E**nvironment for **L**earning, **I**nteraction, and **O**bservatio**N**

A high-performance physics simulation framework built from the ground up in modern C++.

## 🎯 Overview

AURELION is a comprehensive simulation engine designed for real-time physics calculations, 3D rendering, and interactive environments. Built with a focus on performance, modularity, and clean architecture, it serves as both a learning platform and a foundation for complex simulations.

## ✨ Features

- **High-Performance Math Library**: Custom-built vector and matrix operations optimized for simulation workloads
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
- **Modern C++ Design**: Leveraging C++17/20 features for type safety and performance
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all critical components
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- Git

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AURELION.git
cd AURELION

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build the project
cmake --build .

# Run tests
ctest
```

### Quick Example

```cpp
#include <math/Vector3.h>

int main() {
    math::Vector3 position(10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f);
    math::Vector3 velocity(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    
    // Update position
    position += velocity;
    
    // Calculate distance from origin
    float distance = position.length();
    
    return 0;
}
```

## 🧮 Components

### Math Library
The foundation of AURELION's simulation capabilities:
- `Vector2` - 2D vector operations (in development)
- `Vector3` - 3D vector operations with full arithmetic, normalization, and products
- `Matrix4` - 4x4 transformation matrices (planned)
- `Quaternion` - Rotation representation (planned)

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd build
ctest --verbose
```

For detailed test output:
```bash
./tests/tVector3
```
